# Work Tracker

Work Track is a system to manage and continue projects as well as to save their deadlines. This system allows employees to follow the details of their projects and allows them to file a complaint to resolve the problem if they encounter it at any time during the project.

## Tools and Framework:
For the client-side, I used Flutter the open-source UI software development kit for mobile development.
For the back-end, I used the Firebase which is a set of backend cloud computing services and application development platforms provided by Google.
